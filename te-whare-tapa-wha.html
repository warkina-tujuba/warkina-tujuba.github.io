          <h2>Key Definitions:</h2>
          <h4>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h4>
          <p>
            Taha tinana is your physical wellbeing, focusing on how your body grows, feels, moves, and how you care for it. Nourishing and strengthening physical wellbeing helps you cope with life's ups and downs, and feeling physically well supports mental wellness. Key aspects include physical activity, healthy eating, and good sleep hygiene.
          </p>
          <p><strong>For me, my physical wellbeing is important. I feel uneasy and jittery if I don't get enough exercise in. I have played football since I could walk and currently play for Seatoun AFC in the Capital Premier league in Wellington. We train twice a week with a game on Saturdays - I absolutley adore these times for the comradery it brings.<br> <br> I also go to the gym in the morning 4 x a week as well as yoga on Thursdays - these all play a role to uphold my Taha tinana, my physical wellbeing</strong></p>
          
          <h4>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h4>

          <p>Taha hinengaro encompasses your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts, and feelings. It involves how you feel, communicate, and think. Taking care of taha hinengaro is essential for everyone. Diet, physical activity, and stress management all play roles in supporting emotional and mental wellbeing.</p>
          <p><strong>This is a pillar I struggle with and know a lot do. There are so many external as well as internal factors that can sway the needle in either direction. For me, I gte deeply impacted and influenced by injustices small or large, for example the genocide taking place in Palestine, Sudan and Ethiopia weigh heavy on me. As well as this my job deals with a lot of injutices and thats a lot carry at times. <br> <br> Theraphy and exercise are two strategies I use. 
            In those moments my mind is too busy to be thinking about the world and if only for a fleeting hour... my emotional energy is reserved/recharged.</strong></p>

          <h4>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h4>
          <p>Taha wairua varies widely, from faith and religious beliefs to an internal connection to the universe. It’s an important part of mental wellbeing, expressed through beliefs, values, traditions, and practices that support self-awareness and identity. Taha wairua offers a sense of meaning, purpose, and connectedness to self, whānau, community, nature, and the sacred.</p>
          <p><strong>Taking this literally, I have a strong religious underpinning being raised as a Christian all my life. Its important to me and acts a north-start when making moral decisions and to choose a path of love.<br> <br> 
            My spirituality and beliefs ground me and give me an understanding of "love". I believe "love" to be the underpinning force that makes bees buzz, birds sing and zigs... well, zag.</strong></p>
          
          <h4>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h4>
          <p>
            Taha whānau focuses on belonging, caring, and sharing life with others, including extended relationships like friends, colleagues, and community. Whānau contributes to individual wellbeing and identity, providing purpose, connection, and support. It plays a central role in your overall wellbeing.</p>

            </div>
         <p><strong>The image above sums up my views on this pillar of health. Its always and alwasy will be about "the people" you surround yourself with. For me, my Ethiopian heritage is also a big part of who I am and how i navigate this world. 
          <br> <br>
          Some thing I do to manage this pillar is living with my parents and spending quality time with my friends. Also, helping within my community is a big privillage and a job I love to do.</strong></p>
            <h4>Whenua (Land)</h4>
          <p>
            Whenua, or land, is the foundation for the other four dimensions. The health of the land is connected to your health and wellbeing, offering a sense of belonging. Connection to nature improves mental and physical wellbeing. Embracing nature, even in small ways, can strengthen your overall wellbeing through whenua.
          </p>
          <p><strong>This is also a very key pillar and I get my fix by gardening with my old man most Sunday's. It is absolutley humbling picking our own veggies and reaping what we sew (that doesn't sound right lol). The land is forever giving and also feels like and ode to our families "Farmer" background in Ethiopia.</strong></p>
