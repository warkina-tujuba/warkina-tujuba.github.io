          <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
          <h3>30 June 2024</h3>
          <h2>Key Definitions:</h2>
          <h4>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h4>
          <p>
            Think of HTML as the cake's structure. It’s the basic foundation
            that shapes everything. It tells the browser what each part of the
            website is, like headings, paragraphs, and images.
          </p>
          <h4>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h4>
          <p>
            CSS is like the icing and decorations on the cake. It makes your
            website look pretty by adding colors, fonts, and layout styles.
          </p>
          <h4>JavaScript:</h4>
          <p>
            JS is the magic ingredient that makes the cake come to life!
            JavaScript adds interactivity, like buttons that do something when
            you click them or images that change when you hover over them.
          </p>
          <h4>DOM (Document Object Model):</h4>
          <p>
            The DOM as a map of your cake. It helps you find and change
            different parts of the website. The DOM is a tree-like structure
            that represents all the HTML elements on your page.
          </p>
          <h4>Google DevTools:</h4>
          <p>
            Google DevTools are special tools in the Chrome browser that let you
            peek inside your cake and see how it’s made. You can use DevTools to
            inspect and tweak your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make sure
            everything works perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>These technologies work together to create and manage interactive web pages:
            <ul>
              <li>HTML provides the structure.</li>
              <li>CSS styles the elements.</li>
              <li>JavaScript manipulates the elements and styles through the DOM.</li>
              <li>DevTools help developers debug and optimize their code.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-item">
          <img
            src="blog-images/big3.jpeg"
            alt="html, css and java with best friends written above it"
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Understanding Control Flow, Loops, Arrays, and Objects</h2>
          <p>
            Now, let's look at some programming concepts: 
          </p>
          <p><strong>Control Flow:</strong> refers to the order in which the code executes. It includes structures like conditionals (if, else) and loops that determine the path the program takes.</p>
      <p><strong>Loops:</strong> are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Common types of loops are for, while, and do...while loops. They help automate repetitive tasks.</p>
      <p><strong>Arrays:</strong> are collections of items stored in a single variable. Each item can be accessed by its index. Arrays are useful for storing lists of data.
        <div class="image-item">
          <img
            src="blog-images/js-loops.png"
            alt="loops"
          />
        </div>
      <p><strong>Objects</strong> are collections of key-value pairs. They are used to store related data and functions together.
      </p>
      <h2>Understanding Functions</h2>
      <p>Functions are like special recipes you can use anytime you need to perform a specific task. They help you organise your code into reusable chunks.</p>
      <p>Functions make your code easier to read and manage because you can use the same function in different places without writing the same code over and over.</p>

      <h2>Interacting with the DOM using JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript is fundamental to creating dynamic and interactive web pages. The DOM is a tree-like structure representing the HTML elements of a web page, allowing JavaScript to access and manipulate them. </p> 
        <p>By using JavaScript, developers can select elements, change their content, styles, and attributes, and respond to user events. 
          For instance, selecting an element can be done using methods like:</p> 
          <ul> 
          <li>getElementById</li> 
          <li> querySelector </li> 
          <p> Once selected, JavaScript can modify the element’s inner HTML, adjust its CSS styles, or change its attributes. This enables a web page to be updated in real-time without requiring a page reload.</p>
          <p>Event handling is another crucial aspect of DOM manipulation. JavaScript allows developers to add event listeners to HTML elements, enabling the web page to respond to user actions such as clicks, key presses, or mouse movements. Functions like addEventListener are used to bind specific functions to these events, ensuring that when an event occurs, the corresponding function is executed. This interaction capability is key to creating rich, interactive user experiences. </p> 
          <p>example, a button click can trigger a form submission, an animation, or a data fetch operation from a server, all facilitated by JavaScript manipulating the DOM in response to user inputs.</p>
