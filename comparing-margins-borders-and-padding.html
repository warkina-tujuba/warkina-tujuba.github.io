          <h3>Understanding the "Box-Model"</h3>   
          <p>
            The “Box-Model'' allows programmers to create websites that are well-structured, pleasing to the eye aand ultimately, websites that are more user-friendly. In simpler forms, the Box-Model refers to how elements on a webpage are structured and sized. 

            It is illustrated (see image below) by three rectangular squares with the center being home to the content. The outer layer is the “margin”, next is the “border”, followed by the “padding”. Understanding and being able to manipulate these components is crucial for layout and design purposes.

          <h3>Differentiate between Margin, Border, Padding and Content</h3> 
          <p>
            Margin = The outermost layer of the box-model, plays the role of separating elements from other elements and does not affect the elements size.
            Border = Lying between the margin and padding, borders are a design choice that is used to separate elements (visually) from their surroundings. 
            Padding = This is the inner-mostclosest layer to the content of a web-page. Padding is used to help create space and attention towards the content. 
            Content = This is where the money is! The center of the box. Content is responsible for holding all the content of the wep-page such as text, images and media.

            stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
