          <h2>Understanding Emotional Intelligence </h2>        
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is a vital aspect of our personal and professional lives, often overshadowed by traditional measure of Intelligence Quotient (IQ). 
            <br> <br> While IQ focuses on cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills, EQ encompasses our capacity to recognise, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as comprehend and influence the emotions of others. 
            This distinction is crucial in today's interconnected world. Success often depends not just on technical prowess but on how effectively we navigate relationships and understand human dynamics.

          <h3>The Difference Between IQ and EQ</h3>  
          <p>
            Unlike IQ, which remains relatively stable throughout life, EQ is flexible and can be developed over time with awareness and practice.</p>
            <p>It encompasses traits such as self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills. Individuals with high EQ excel in managing stress, communicating effectively, resolving conflicts, and fostering positive relationships. They can navigate social complexities with ease, making them invaluable in leadership roles, team environments, and customer-facing positions.
          </p>
          <h3>Relevance of EQ in Personal Context</h3>  
          <p>
            Personally, I find EQ indispensable in my interactions with colleagues, friends, and family. </p> 
            <p>Recognising and empathising with others' emotions allows me to build stronger connections and nurture meaningful relationships. It enables me to adapt my communication style to different personalities and situations, fostering mutual understanding and respect.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in professional settings, EQ helps me navigate workplace dynamics, manage stress effectively, and lead teams by motivating and empowering others.

          <p>Practising mindfulness has been instrumental in enhancing my EQ. Engaging in sports not only helps me stay physically fit but also serves as a form of active meditation, where I can clear my mind and focus solely on the present moment. </p>
          <p>Additionally, attending yoga sessions every Thursday morning provides me with dedicated time to cultivate mindfulness through breathing exercises and physical postures. Yoga not only strengthens my body but also calms my mind, improving my ability to stay centred and present throughout the day.</p>
