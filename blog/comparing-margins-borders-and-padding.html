          <h3>Understanding the "Box-Model"</h3>   
          <p>
            The “Box-Model'' allows programmers to create websites that are well-structured, pleasing to the eye aand ultimately, websites that are more user-friendly. In simpler forms, the Box-Model refers to how elements on a webpage are structured and sized. 

            It is illustrated (see image below) by three rectangular squares with the center being home to the content. The outer layer is the “margin”, next is the “border”, followed by the “padding”. Understanding and being able to manipulate these components is crucial for layout and design purposes.

          <h3>Differentiate between Margin, Border, Padding and Content</h3> 
          <p>
            Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as
            he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two
            large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey
            over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few
            hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he
            went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet
            potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted
            stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
