          <h4>Discuss a time when you were blocked on a simple problem:</h4>

            Think of HTML as the cake's structure. It’s the basic foundation
            that shapes everything. It tells the browser what each part of the
            website is, like headings, paragraphs, and images.

          <h4>Discuss a time when you elegantly solved a problem:</h4>

            The example that comes to mind is 2021 when the African Community Council Members were bringing to life our overall strategy to outline our ambitions, plans and the systems we wanted to establish. 
            We were at a crossroads in that everyone on the board are highly proficient members of various African Communities and more often then not, held high positions prior so essentially a clash of the titans and little old me. <br> <br> 
            The issue that arose was that we all had ideas, everyone, in their heart of hearts were well-intentioned and worked for the betterment of their communities but all struggled to listen and hear another position and view. This, in-return made the individuals dig in their heels for their idea. Essentially, all were pretty much saying the same thing in a different way. <br> <br> 
            I ran a workshop for the team to showcase this in a way that was not aggressive or demoralising. The workshop consisted of three stages  
          </p>
          <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4>
          <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong> <br> 
            This is the process of leaving comments that tell what the code should do. I.e. what you are trying to do.</p>
            <p>This is a new one and one I am only just getting used to. I underdstand the idea and how it plays into the same idea of drawing out a wire-frame of a website on a blank piece of paper before begining to code. I belief I will use this method quite regulary to provide structure of my code and to remain focused on what it exactly I am trying to do. This process will also help in producing attractive and "Clean Code".</p>
          <p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> <br> 
            The Rubber Ducky Method is when you talk through your code to a rubber ducky (or any inanimate object, really) to help you work through a problem.</p>
            <p>This is a very clever process and is underpin by the view... "if you can teach it, you know it" (or something like that). I have done this subconsciously as I get excited about what I have learnt and look to explain it to my friends. A lot harder than expected! What this process does is make you look for new ways/words to explain a situation to "dumb-it-down" while getting the process, concept or idea across. I will use this process a lot more but in a more blog form.</p>
          <p><strong>Console.logging</strong> <br> 
            By strategically placing console.log() statements throughout their code, developers gain insights that allow them to pinpoint where errors occur or unexpected behaviors manifest.</p>
            <p>Confidence on this one is growing but is relatively low. I get confused as to when to use it and how it pops open in DOM. I get the idea and have seen it during exercises but struggle to open and see when not working on a website based code. This sounds silly just writing it out and I look forward to mastering this one.</p>
          <h4>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h4>
