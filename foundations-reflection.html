          <h3>15 July 2024</h3>  
          <h2>Time Management </h2>        
          <p>
            Amidst, all the deep learning within foundations, most of my learnings have been internal. On the top of this mountain... I have poor time management. 
            <br> <br> Let me expand before you turn into the worst work reference. A midst all the moving parts of starting a new course, I didn't manage my affairs prior to starting the course. All while doing the course, I was/am a board member for two different organistions, playing prem football with three trainings a week and a transltor for Work and Income hahahha you laugh or cry at these things. 
            <br> <br>So it may not be exactly "poor time management" but rather a sense of over commitment married with underestimating the time required for Founation/the overall course. We live and we learn. Laugh or cry.

          <h3>Workload</h3>  
          <p>
            From the start I was behind due to a broken laptop and where I assured myself it wasn't a problem. It slowly grew to becoming a problem... internally.</p>
            <p>I felt so shit being a week behind everyone. Like chasing a shadow and they may have had a bigger effect on me. From the start, the team put together programmes and initiative to manage this (like the older person giving the teenager advice that falls on deaf ears) but I just wanted everything to catch up. I quickly fell into the loop of missing lectures to catch up on lectures. Silly.  </p>
          <h3>Foundations was fun!</h3>  
          <p>
            I know, the irony isn't lost on me. It was hard but I enjoy hard... "hard times build character" or something like that. </p> 
            <p>I've learnt so much more about myself than the actual coding. I've discovered my love and dependency of being the "connector" and people person as a tool to hide what may possibly be my lack of technical ability. I've worked on a muscle I am good at in the past and left supporting muscles for dead.</p>
            <p>I think quite differently and see this as a unique value proposition for myself and honestly adding these skills to my toolbelt is so good. Its a dangerous combination adding technical capabilites on top of all the ideas I have.

          <h3>Wins?</h3>  
          <p>Paused and reassessed and got back into the swing of things. Quickly realised, while there are numerous hands offering support I am the only one that can do the work. So frankly, I just rejigged the schedule and got to work. </p>
          <h3>Favourite project?</h3>  
          <p>Tic-tac-toe was lit! I really enjoyed putting all the learning together for this one. It was also a very cool one to show friends.
