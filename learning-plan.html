            Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
            his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
            (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short
            distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to
            prepare the hangi.

            Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as
            he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two
            large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey
            over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few
            hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he
            went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet
            potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
