          <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
          <h3>16 June 2024</h3>
          <h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway? </h3>           
          <p>My true north in life is to help progress the living standards of migrants and refugees that call New Zealand home, with an early, predominant focus on the African Communities (to which I belong) that call Wellington home. This true north gives reason to whatever I do and acts as a guide in making life/career decisions. My true north is underpinned by three pillars:</p>
           <p>
      “The tree will grow regardless if you plant it or I do. If you plant it, I will water it, they will prune it and we will build a fence to protect the vulnerable sprout” <br>
      “Before you change the world, which you will, clean your room. Do the small behind the scenes mahi that often goes unrecognized and do it well. It is attractive to have a Big Hairy Ambitious Goal, but break it down into its fundamentals.” <br>
      “You learn to write the way your teacher writes. If they link, you link, if they slant, you slant. Be wary of your teachers and more, go in search of new teachers to build an arsenal of problem-solving capabilities so you can link and slant.”<br>
           </p>
    <p>While I do believe I would be able to have a greater impact in this mission through political ambitions (both local council and as an MP), I believe there are numerous steps before this. I can assist those already working in this area and in the process learn and be a good student.</p>
    <p>I am currently an elected member of the African Community Council Wellington where I oversee the Youth and Engagement Portfolio.</p>

          <h3> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h3>
  
          <p>People, people, people! As the Māori proverb goes:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>“He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata.”</p>
              <p>What is the most important thing? It is people, it is people, it is people.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <div class="image-item">
            <img src="blog-images/people.jpeg" alt="cartoon image show casing variation in NZ">
          </div>
          <p>I truly believe that in understanding the person, most disagreements and conflicts can be resolved. I pride myself in being able to engage with people to make them heard and listened to. I have an ability to make people feel included and welcome. This has been a trait consistent with whatever mahi I dive into.</p>
          <p>In the same light… my weakness is people too! I can easily get distracted. I will prioritize listening to people sometimes at my own expense. I am also a shoulder and listening board for a lot of people and sometimes, things can get heavy.</p>
          <h3> What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>Time management. I really want to improve in this sector to ensure I meet deadlines promptly as I understand the frustration of juggling and looking/being rushed in a team environment. I don’t want to be “that guy”.</p>
          <p>I have already begun using Toggle more religiously as well as organizing my personal calendar. The next step is sticking to it!</p>
        
          <h3> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
          <p>This starts with my own self-analysis and reaching out when needed. This autonomy in learning is beneficial and anchored in trust, which is perfect for a busy person like me, and so I want to respect this trust through clear communication.</p>
          <p>My commitment begins with an organized calendar. This calendar will include extracurricular activities and time slots booked in for specific work. As well as this, I will schedule “distraction/break time” where I will do activities not related to the work I am doing, possibly revisit past work, or stretch tasks from previous weeks.</p>
          <p>On top of this, the utilization of tutors and being in the office to ask questions, have another eye look over code, and ask for recommendations to improve/streamline work.</p>
          <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4> 
          <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h1>
            <p>I have to trust and believe it is okay that I am not at the pace of everyone else. My learning has nothing to do with my peers, just as the facilitators have stated. Instead, I will focus on my own mahi. When things start to build up, I will begin by meditating and identifying where the stress is coming from (it is often anchored in the fear of being behind, which I know is not the end of the world). They say writing out the problem is 80% of solving it.</p>
          <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
            <p>Following this I will ask and hopefully set up an extra scheduled session with Jospeh on Wednesdays to catch up and chat code. As well as, add some transparency about where I am and how things are going in order to get adequate support.
            </p>
          <h3> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            My expectation of the facilitation team is no different from my expectations of my peers - respect and transparency. They have gone out of their way and in the same light, I need to provide the same thing back to them. 
          </p>
          <h3> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</h3>
          <p>
            Yup. I have commitments with African Council Meetings on Tuesday mornings as well blocking out 2 hours every Thursday to oversee the teams and the work they are doing. I havefootball trainings Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, which is obviously after mahi but a consideration nonetheless.
