      <h3>Understanding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, and Google DevTools</h3>
      <p>Hey there! Let's talk about some cool stuff you can do with websites. Imagine building a website is like making a cake. You need different ingredients and tools to make it awesome. Here are the main ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong> (Hypertext Markup Language): Think of HTML as the cake's structure. It’s the basic foundation that shapes everything. It tells the browser what each part of the website is, like headings, paragraphs, and images.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is like the icing and decorations on the cake. It makes your website look pretty by adding colors, fonts, and layout styles.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: This is the magic ingredient that makes the cake come to life! JavaScript adds interactivity, like buttons that do something when you click them or images that change when you hover over them.</li>
        <li><strong>DOM</strong> (Document Object Model): Imagine the DOM as a map of your cake. It helps you find and change different parts of the website. The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents all the HTML elements on your page.</li>
        <li><strong>Google DevTools</strong>: These are special tools in the Chrome browser that let you peek inside your cake and see how it’s made. You can use DevTools to inspect and tweak your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make sure everything works perfectly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding Control Flow, Loops, Arrays, and Objects</h3>
      <p>Now, let's talk about some programming concepts that will help you control what your website does:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Control Flow</strong>: This is like giving your cake-making steps in a specific order. It’s the sequence in which your code runs, deciding what happens first, second, and so on. You use things like <code>if</code> statements to make decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Loops</strong>: Loops are like making several cakes without repeating the same steps over and over. They let you run the same code multiple times. For example, a <code>for</code> loop can help you display a list of items on your website.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrays</strong>: Think of arrays as boxes that can hold multiple items. If you have a list of favorite ice cream flavors, you can put them all in an array and access each one easily.
          <pre><code>let flavors = ["Vanilla", "Chocolate", "Strawberry"];
console.log(flavors[0]); // Vanilla</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Objects</strong>: Objects are like more complex boxes. They can hold different types of information about something. For example, a person object can have properties like name, age, and favorite color.
          <pre><code>let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  favoriteColor: "Blue"
};
console.log(person.name); // John</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding Functions</h3>
      <p>Functions are like special recipes you can use anytime you need to perform a specific task. They help you organize your code into reusable chunks. For example, you can have a function that greets someone:
        <pre><code>function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice!</code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>Functions make your code easier to read and manage because you can use the same function in different places without writing the same code over and over.</p>

      <h3>Interacting with the DOM using JavaScript</h3>
      <p>JavaScript can also interact with the DOM to change your web page dynamically. For example, you can change the text of a button when it is clicked:
        <pre><code>document.querySelector('#test-button').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  event.target.innerHTML = "Woah!";
});</code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>This code does the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Finds the button with the id <code>test-button</code>.</li>
          <li>Adds an event listener for when the button is clicked.</li>
          <li>Changes the button's text to "Woah!" when it is clicked.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>By using JavaScript and the DOM, you can make your web pages interactive and fun, responding to what users do in real-time. This is how you make websites that are not just static but also engaging and dynamic!</p>
