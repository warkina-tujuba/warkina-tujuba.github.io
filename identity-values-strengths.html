          <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths <br> Exploration</h1>

          <h3>16 June 2024</h3>          
          <h3>Identity</h3>   
          <p>
            I find this such a fascinating question.</p>
            <p> Pondering over this, before doing research, I defined “identifty” as the individual within a larger context, the community. My identity is anchored in my communities. 
Community to me is “a united group over a common”. Based on this I belong to the Ethiopian community that are united in calling Wellington, New Zealand their home. I am also united with the community of mid-late 20’s trying to figure out what their purpose is, I am one with the introverts in disguise as extroverts.

          <h3>Values</h3> 
          <p>My values are underpinned by three mammoth perspectives; respect, trust and challenge.</p>
          <p> and trust are two values that everyone I first meet begin with. This is often contrary to a belief that these values are “earnt” over time and actions. I believe and practise the opposite; I have no reason to not respect or trust someone so they automatically start with it. It is what they do with this respect and trust that determines whether they keep it or not. Abused, these attritibutes that were once given freely - need to be earnt back. 
            Challenge is a tricky one to explain. It is a byproduct of another pillar of mine; “You learn to write the way your teacher writes. If they link, you link, if they slant, you slant. Be wary of your teachers and more, go in search of new teachers to build an arsenal of problem solving capabilities so you can link and slant.” These pillars drive me to learn different skills from an array of humans in order to have a tool kit that can deal with all the various challenges that life brings. When I say “Challenge” I am referring to questioning processes and systems that are systematic “That's the way we’ve always done it” energy.

          <h3>Strengths</h3> 
          <p>
            In search for an answer on this I did the DOPE 4 Personality type. The DOPE personality test is a behavioral assessment tool that categorizes people into four primary personality types: Dove, Owl, Peacock, and Eagle. Guess what I was…. A damn Peacock! Honestly I’m not surprised and I know, not necceasily a bad thing but you and I both know the connotations. 

This does align in my love for people. I have an absolute love in understanding the behaviouisms of people and it's definitely a strength I cherish and would not give up and if that makes me a peacock, so be it! eye roll.
